# ðŸ§¬ GPCR-Targeted Therapeutics for Long COVID  
_A Comprehensive Bioinformatics Study_

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is a chronic condition with lingering symptoms such as fatigue, neurological impairments, and respiratory issues. Current treatment options are limited. This study explores the role of **GPCRs**, a major class of druggable cell-surface receptors, as potential therapeutic targets. The project integrates multiple bioinformatics approaches to:

- Identify GPCRs associated with long COVID genes
- Analyze sequence/function/network relationships
- Simulate molecular interactions
- Suggest possible FDA-approved or repurposed drugs

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives

- **Functional Mapping**: Identify long COVID-related genes with GPCR involvement
- **Network Analysis**: Prioritize key GPCR targets using Cytoscape & STRING
- **Docking Simulations**: Perform ligandâ€“receptor docking for interaction affinity
- **Drug Repurposing**: Highlight potential treatments from known drugs
